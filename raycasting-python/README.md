# Raycasting tutorial with Python
![demo](demo.gif)
![demo2](demo2.gif)

This is the repository with all the code that will be used on my new [Raycasting tutorial](https://youtu.be/E18bSJezaUE) on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@pythonista_333?sub_confirmation=1). This project is very important because I really wanted to share this knowledge with everyone. The resources available online that explain this topic are not good in my opinion, so I decided to pick the best parts of each one and make The Definitive Raycasting Guide.

## How to run
1. First, you need to have `pygame` installed 
    ```
    pip3 install pygame
    ```
2. Clone this repository and enter the folder
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Magoninho/raycasting-python
    ```
    ```
    cd raycasting-python
    ```
3. Run the project
    ```
    python3 main.py
    ```

> Note: if you are on **Windows**, you may need to replace `pip3` with `pip` and `python3` with `python`
